//! Error codes for platform services
//!
//! A platform service can end in one of three ways:
//! 
//! 1. *Success*, in which the platform service successfully executed,
//! 2. *Unavailable*, in which the service in question is not available on
//!    the current platfrom.  For example: a trusted time source may not be
//!    available on all platforms that Veracruz supports.
//! 3. *UnknownError*: the service is available, but there was some error
//!    raised during service execution.
